# Freechains: Types of Chains

Freechains supports three types of chains with different purposes:

- *Public Identity:*
    - `1 -> N` and `1 <-N` communication.
    - A public identity broadcasts content to an audience (`1 -> N`) with
      optional feedback (`1 <- N`).
    - Examples: news site, streaming service, public profile in social media.
- *Private Group:*
    - `1 <-> 1`, `N <-> N`, `1 <-` private communication.
    - Trusted communication between pairs, groups, and alone (with itself).
    - Examples: e-mail, family WhatsApp group, backup.
- *Public Forum:*
    - `N <-> N` public communication.
    - Public communication among untrusted participants.
    - Examples: Q&A forums, chats, consumer-to-consumer sales.
