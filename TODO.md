- cts/ids check each other
- sort sync by ping timeout
- ping: return version
- peer chains return one by line with parameters
- return codes from org.freechains.host.cli
- permission for client
- android app client para controlar host: registrar hosts, chains, users, etc, receber notificacoes
- passar dir de instalacao p/ install
- show IPs in connections
- test 50 random very slow chains each host
- two simulation at the same time
- allow binary pay
- site to track: last access, chains heads
- liferea, /home, docs
- PROTO:
  - autor fork: merge largest instead of reject
  - prunning (hash of bases, starts with genesis), if they don't match, permanent fork
    - new idea 4-month window every org.freechains.host.host.day at 0:00
- HOST: "create" receives pub/pvt args
  - creates pvt chain oo (for logs, periodic bcast)
  - save CFG in a chain
  - join reputation system (evaluate continue@xxx)
  - replicate command (all state)
  - all conns start with pubs from both ends
- TEST
  - oonly, N16_blocked, S128_payload
  - proof that pay="" is really hidden
- REFACTOR
  - join (stop/now), they use connection
  - chain/.* move dir files
- CMDS
  - freechains now s/ time (retorna now)
  - freechains host restart
  - freechains crypto w/o passphrase (to self generate)
- VERSIONS
  - jvm,android,lua
  - remove jar from repo, use github releases
- LIFEREA
  - likes in title // get rep in menu and each post owner
  - autochain, first post introducing itself (ID/photo?)
  - menu:
    - dot
    - like w/ ui for nick/pub
- IMPL:
  - fix org.freechains.host.host.getNow() per handle()
  - org.freechains.host.host.blockAssert: verify symmetric auth
  - sends in parallel
  - blk/hash variations for all functions (avoid extra blockLoads)
  - when too many blocks, no reader returns soon, so reader timeout
- IDEAS:
  - chain for restauration of state in other host holding all necessary commands
- Aether client
- commands with auth. ip port time to avoid reuse
- RX Kotlin
- pipes / filtros
- Future:
- Xfreechains
  - chain xtraverse
- Android WiFi Direct
- crypto host-to-host
- RPi: cable eth + wifi router + phones
